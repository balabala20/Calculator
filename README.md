**🚀 Just Built a Fully Functional Calculator with React! 🚀**  

I'm excited to share my latest project—a **fully functional calculator** built using **React**! ➕➖✖️➗  

### **What I Learned & Applied:**  
✅ Mastered **React's useState hook** for state management  
✅ Implemented **clean and reusable functions** for calculations  
✅ Strengthened my understanding of **component-based architecture**  
✅ Improved **event handling** and **dynamic UI updates**  

Building this calculator was a great way to solidify my React fundamentals while creating something practical. Every step—from designing the logic to debugging—taught me something new!  

Would love to hear your feedback! Have you built something similar? Let’s connect and discuss! 👇
